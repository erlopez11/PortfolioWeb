# Description
This is the website I created to serve as my portfolio for frontend development. It is a single page portfolio website, unlike the first portfolio I created which was a multi-page website. This site contains four sections: the home/into section, about section, portfolio section, and a contact section. The portfolio section displays six project that I have created so far. When clicked, each project image provides a breif description and a link to view  a live demo. This roject was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Design
After completing my first portfolio website, I wasn't too enhusiastic about the layout, the color choices, and the minimal JS functionality I added to it; so I decided to redesign more minimally as a single page portfolio website with a different layout and color scheme. After creating my own drawings for the Terrarium Build website, I decided to once again create my own illustrations for my own portfolio website that would represent me better. I drew two illustations in Krita to use as the hero image and a bottom of the page image representing some of the tools that I use for frontend development. I also changed the color scheme so that the color palettte is used more as accents instead of as primary colors giving it a calm and less cluttered feel.

I wanted to include the use of more Javascipt in this project, specifically in helping the user reach different areas of the page since it is one single page, as well as in providing additional space for information on my portfolio projects without having to link to a completely seperate portfolio or project page. I decided to link the navigation sections to their corresponding section within the body of the website after I learned how to apply that functionality in a technical page project in FreeCodeCamp. The current section is then displayed using an orange underline below the name of the section in the navigation bar. My hope was that adding this would simplify the user's sccessibility to different sections of my website, without having to scroll through every section.

I also used JavaScript in the portfolio section, to add pop-up boxes that display a brief description of the project and a link to a live demo of it. I did this, as a way to avoid overcluttering the portfolio section with information and so that the user can focus solely on the image of the project, its name, and the languages used before they are presented with additional information and the links. Then if the user is curious about project's code, mark-up, or styling, they can use the github link in the contact section to visit my github. I wanted the projects to be displayed as neatly and concisely as possible to avoid drowing the sectino in information.

# Further Implementation 
I have noticed that there are still some sizing and layout issues when viewing the site on a small laptop screen. th image at the bottom og the page starts to flow into the footer and overlaps it.
